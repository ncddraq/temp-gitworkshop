1. What is Spring Boot and how is it different from traditional Spring framework?

Spring Boot is a framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that can be deployed with minimal configuration. It automates the configuration process, simplifying the development and deployment process. Traditional Spring framework requires developers to manually configure different components, which can be time-consuming.

2. Explain the concept of inversion of control and dependency injection in Spring.

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design pattern that involves delegating the responsibility of object creation and management to a container, instead of creating objects explicitly in the application code. Dependency Injection (DI) is a type of IoC pattern, which is used to inject the dependent objects into the client code rather than the client code creating them explicitly. In Spring, DI is achieved using constructor injection or setter injection.

3. What is the role of Spring MVC in a web application?

Spring MVC is a framework used for building web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It provides an easy-to-use, flexible and powerful framework for developing web applications. It separates the concerns of the application into three different layers: Model, View, and Controller.

4. What is AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) and how is it used in Spring?

AOP is a programming paradigm that enables the separation of concerns in an application by allowing the modularization of cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and transaction management. Spring uses AOP to implement various features such as transaction management, security, and caching.

5. How do you configure a data source in Spring Boot application?

To configure a data source in Spring Boot application, you need to specify the properties for the data source in the application.properties file, or application.yml file. Here is an example configuration for a MySQL database:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=password

6. What is the difference between @Component, @Service, @Repository and @Controller annotations in Spring?

@Component is a generic stereotype annotation for any Spring-managed component. @Service is a specialized annotation for declaring services. @Repository is a specialized annotation for declaring repository or DAO classes. @Controller is a specialized annotation for declaring controller classes used in Spring MVC.

7. How do you implement exception handling in a Spring Boot application?

Exception handling in Spring Boot can be implemented using the @ExceptionHandler annotation, which allows handling of specific exceptions thrown during the execution of a request. You can also use @ControllerAdvice to define global exception handling for all controllers.

8. Write a sample code to demonstrate the use of Spring Security for authentication and authorization.

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
 
    @Autowired
    private UserDetailsService userDetailsService;
 
    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.userDetailsService(userDetailsService);
    }
 
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .antMatchers("/user/**").hasAnyRole("ADMIN", "USER")
                .antMatchers("/").permitAll()
                .and()
                .formLogin();
    }
 
    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }
}

9. What is JPA and how does it relate to Spring Data JPA?

JPA (Java Persistence API) is a standard interface for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Java. It provides a set of specifications for mapping Java objects to
